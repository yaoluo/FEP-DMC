# Input parameters
#
prefix:
   family: general
   type: string
   typical: prefix
   description: Job name prefix. It should be the same as the prefix used in QE.
 
outdir:
   family: general
   type: string
   typical: ./tmp
   description: Name of the directory where the QE nscf output directory prefix.save is located, and where the e-ph matrix elements prefix_elph.h5 will be stored.

phdir:
   family: general
   type: string
   typical: phdir
   description: Name of the directory where the phonon "save" directory is located.

dft_band_min:
   family: general
   type: integer 
   default: 1
   description: Lowest band index used in Wannier90.

dft_band_max:
   family: general
   type: integer 
   default: 10000
   description: Highest band index used in Wannier90. Be default, it will be reset to the highest band index in the DFT results.

dis_win_min:
   family: general
   type: real
   default: -9999.0
   description: The 'dis_win_min' used in Wannier90, the lower boundary of the outer windows.


num_wann:
   family: general
   type: integer
   default: 1
   description: Number of Wannier functions.

system_2d:
   family: general
   type: logical
   default: False
   description: Set it to .true. if the system is 2D.

nk1:
   family: general
   type: integer
   typical: 8
   description: Number of k points along x-axis used in the Wannierization.

nk2:
   family: general
   type: integer
   typical: 8
   description: Number of k points along y-axis used in the Wannierization.

nk3:
   family: general
   type: integer
   typical: 8
   description: Number of k points along z-axis used in the Wannierization.

debug:
   family: general
   type: logical
   default: False   
   description: Set to .true. to turn on the debug mode, in which the code stop after g(k,q) (does not compute g in wannier basis)

lwannier:
   family: general
   type: logical 
   default: True
   description: Set to .true. to rotate the wavefunctions using Wannier unitary matrix before computing e-ph matrix elements.

load_ephmat:
   family: general
   type: logical
   default: False
   description: Set to .true. to load prefix_elph.h5 from the directory specified by the variable outdir.

eig_corr:
   family: general
   type: string
   typical: eig_corr
   description: File containing the electron eigenvalues on the (nk1, nk2, nk3) grid. The format of this file is the same as the file <code>prefix.eig</code> generated in Wannier90. if present, <code>qe2pert.x</code> will read the eigenvalues from this file, rather than Kohn-Sham eigenvalues from QE-nscf calculation. This is usually used when one wants to use modified eigenvalues (e.g., from GW).

polar_alpha:
   family: general
   type: real
   default: 1.0   
   description: Convergence parameter used in the Ewald sum when computing the polar correction in polar materials. The default value is 1.0.

asr:
   family: general
   type: string
   default: 'crystal'
   options:
      no: no Acoustic Sum Rules imposed
      simple: 3 translational asr imposed by correction of the diagonal elements of the force constants matrix
      crystal: 3 translational asr imposed by optimized correction of the force constants (projection)
   description: Indicates the type of Acoustic Sum Rule imposed.

thickness_2d:
   family: general
   type: real
   default: 6.0
   units: Ã…
   description: Thickness of the 2d system, used in the 2D polar e-ph correction. Only needed when system_2d=.true.
